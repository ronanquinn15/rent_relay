# Rent Relay

## Description

In Northern Ireland, rental demand is rising as homeownership is decreasing. Rental transactions from 2023 increased
marginally by 1.4%, with renting prices in the past year having increased by 9.6% and 11.5% in Belfast and outside the
city respectively. Meanwhile, property purchases have been at their lowest level decreasing by 26% compared to the
previous quarter. Landlordsâ€™ portfolios are ever increasing, and as they struggle to manage them efficiently, leading to
long delays in resolving maintenance issues.

These inefficiencies directly impact tenants, who experience frustration when their concerns are not addressed in a
timely manner. Delayed responses and uncertainty about whether maintenance requests have even been seen create a
breakdown in communication. Over time, this leads to strained relationships between landlords and tenants, exacerbating
the challenges in the rental sector.

I saw the need for this web app during my time as a tenant in student accommodation when I developed a chest infection
due to mould in my room. After reaching out to the landlord with no timely response, I had to seek medical treatment.
This experience underscored the urgent need for a more transparent and accountable way for tenants to communicate with
landlords, which inspired the development of this web app. The platform aims to streamline communication and ensure that
maintenance requests and tenant concerns are managed efficiently, ultimately improving tenant-landlord relationships.

## Project Aim

To create a web application to streamline communication to help reduce these challenges and ensure both parties are
heard, and timely actions are taken. This improves overall satisfaction and peace of mind for tenants and landlords
alike. Tenants will be able to message certain landlords about their property. Messages can be deleted and edited.
Landlords will be able to view their properties and manage tenant queries with ease.
